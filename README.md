# T'Lyn

The files in this repository are those that I use for the
"T'Lyn T'Lursday" memes that I've been posting to the
Lower Decks Facebook page. This repository is open source
(MIT license) and can be used without credit. The images
used in the repo are owned by their creators, but I believe
they can be used on a fair use basis. Disclaimer, I'm not
a lawyer.

tlursday.svg is the SVG file for assembling the memes. Other
images are linked to within the SVG file.

tlursday.svg contains memes that I haven't published yet.
Please don't publish those memes.

Editing tlursday.svg requires some advanced knowledge of Inkscape.
In particular, the file makes extensive use of layers. Consult
an Inkscape tutorial for how to use layers.
